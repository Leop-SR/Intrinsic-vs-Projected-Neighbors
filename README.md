Intrinsic vs Projected Neighbors: A Study Using PCA and KNN

1. Motivation

This project aims to explore how dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly Principal Component Analysis (PCA), affect neighborhood structures in datasets and their impact on distance-based algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

The motivation behind this work is to connect the mathematical foundations of linear algebra and geometry with practical machine learning workflows, focusing on preprocessing decisions and their consequences on model behavior.

2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of physicochemical measurements related to wine quality. It includes multiple continuous features measured on different scales and a target variable representing wine quality.

Key characteristics of the dataset:

All features are numerical

Features have different units and ranges

Several features exhibit many statistical outliers

No missing values are present
